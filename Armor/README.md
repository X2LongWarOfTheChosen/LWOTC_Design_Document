# Armor
* Light Armor, Heavy Armor, variety of armor in general. More ablative options?
  * What other design angles can we approach ablative from to give it more options?
    * Ablative was mostly vests, can it be incorporated into the actual armor itself?
    * Breakthrough research should add Ablative HP instead of armor
    * All armor should add purely Ablative HP?? since otherwise “Armor damage” needs to be healed in the infirmary, which doesn’t entirely make sense. Ablative HP also can’t be healed by medkits in battle, so it’s as much of a curse as it is a blessing.
      * Bear in mind armor damage reduction does not apply to ablative. You can headcanon the healing of armor damage as “some damage gets through the armor when ablative isn’t in effect”
      * Wasn't it so that sicktime is based on damage taken/total health? If you have 6 health and take 3 damage, you are 50% wounded. Did you on the other hand start with 12 health and take 3 damage, you'd only be 25% wounded and therefore only be in sickbay half the time?
        * Yes, but 6HP and 3 Ablative means you get NO sickbay time for taking 3 damage, whereas if the armor added 3HP instead of 3 Ablative, you would still get sick bay time
* We also had the idea somewhere to reintroduce the HP system of EW
  * Which would make all the grazing much better.
  * Grazing becomes interesting when it's an attrition factor over a mission instead of a "well damn I guess my assault is on vacation for 31 days". Then medkits become useful, because dropping below the threshold leads to vacation time
